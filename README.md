# SWAT+ Dataset Selector

A VS Code extension for SWAT+ development that allows you to browse and select dataset folders for debugging sessions.

## Features

- **Select Dataset Folder**: Browse and select a SWAT+ dataset folder
- **Quick Debug Launch**: Select a dataset folder and immediately start debugging
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with CMake Tools and gdb debugger configurations

## Commands

This extension provides the following commands:

- `SWAT+: Select Dataset Folder` - Browse and select a dataset folder (saves selection for later use)
- `SWAT+: Select Dataset and Debug` - Browse for a dataset folder and immediately launch debug session
- `SWAT+: Debug with Selected Dataset` - Launch debug with previously selected dataset folder

## Usage

### Method 1: Select and Debug in One Step

1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Run `SWAT+: Select Dataset and Debug`
3. Browse to your SWAT+ dataset folder
4. Debug session will start automatically with the selected folder as working directory

### Method 2: Select First, Debug Later

1. Open Command Palette
2. Run `SWAT+: Select Dataset Folder`
3. Browse to your SWAT+ dataset folder
4. Later, run `SWAT+: Debug with Selected Dataset` to launch debug with the selected folder

## How It Works

The extension dynamically launches a debug session with:
- **Type**: `cppdbg` (C++ debugging with gdb)
- **Working Directory**: Your selected dataset folder
- **Program**: Resolved by CMake Tools (`${command:cmake.launchTargetPath}`)
- **Environment**: Includes CMake launch target directory in PATH

This replaces the need to manually edit `launch.json` and change the `cwd` parameter each time you want to debug with a different dataset.

## Requirements

- CMake Tools extension (for `cmake.launchTargetPath` command)
- C/C++ extension (for gdb debugging)
- Properly configured CMake project

## Extension Settings

This extension does not add any VS Code settings.

## Known Issues

- Ensure CMake Tools is properly configured before using this extension
- The debug configuration assumes gdb is available on your system
